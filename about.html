<h1>About Creme de la Creme Bakery! </h1>
<p>
Creme de la Creme Bakery is a full-service Bakery with the first bakery built in 2009. It is located in the heart of Woodcrest, riverside. We also have a second bakery located in Corona, in the Shoppes of Dos Lagos. We are currently building our third location in East Riverside/Moreno Valley Area located at 2692 Canton Springs Parkway across from Rubios. We specialize in cakes for any occasion you can think of.
<br><br>
No two cakes are the same! Every custom cake that is made is unique to your taste. We offer a variety of buttercreams, whipped creams and Fondant.
<br><br>
As a full-service bakery, we bake a large variety of pastries and croissants, as well as fancy desserts like cannolis, napoleans, cream horns, cream puffs and eclairs.
<br><br>
We serve New York Bagels that we ship in on a monthly basis. These bagels are authentic and your first bite, you will taste the difference. We sell them fully cooked or frozen. Your choice!
<br><br>
Lastly, we serve mouth-watering sandwiches on our bread that we make fresh daily. We offer French baguettes, sourdough, rosemary-garlic sourdough, wheat, 7-grain, rye, brioche, Challah bread and a variety of other breads.
